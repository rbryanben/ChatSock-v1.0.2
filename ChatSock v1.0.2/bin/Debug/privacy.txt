Privacy aspects
Right to be let alone
In 1890 the United States jurists Samuel D. Warren and Louis Brandeis wrote "The Right to Privacy",
an article in which they argued for the "right to be let alone", using that phrase as a definition of 
privacy.[1] There is extensive commentary over the meaning of being "let alone", and among other ways, 
it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose seclusion from the attention of others 
if they wish to do so, and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings,
such as one's own home.[1] Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that
made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy, it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for
individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights.[1]

Limited access
Limited access refers to a person's ability to participate in society without having other individuals and
organizations collect information about them.[2]

Various theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one's personal information.[2] 
Edwin Lawrence Godkin wrote in the late 19th century that "nothing is better worthy of legal protection than 
private life, or, in other words, the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself, and to decide for himself
to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion."[2][3] Adopting an approach similar
to the one presented by Ruth Gavison[4] Nine years earlier,[5] Sissela Bok said that privacy is "the condition of 
being protected from unwanted access by others—either physical access, personal information, or attention."[2][6]

Control over information
Control over one's personal information is the concept that "privacy is the claim of individuals, groups,
or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated
to others." Generally, a person who has consensually formed an interpersonal relationship with another person
is not considered "protected" by privacy rights with respect to the person they are in the relationship with. 
[7][8] Charles Fried said that "Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; 
rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves. Nevertheless, in the era of big data, control
over information is under pressure.[9]

States of privacy
Alan Westin defined four states—or experiences—of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. Solitude
is a physical separation from others.[10] Intimacy is a "close, relaxed, and frank relationship between two or
more individuals" that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals.[10] Anonymity is the
"desire of individuals for times of 'public privacy.'"[10] Lastly, reserve is the "creation of a psychological 
barrier against unwanted intrusion"; this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual's
need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning himself or herself.[10]

In addition to the psychological barrier of reserve, Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of
privacy barriers: physical, behavioral, and normative. Physical barriers, such as walls and doors, 
prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual.[11] (In this sense, "accessing" an individual
includes accessing personal information about him or her.)[11] Behavioral barriers communicate to others—verbally, 
through language, or non-verbally, through personal space, body language, or clothing—that an individual does not want 
them to access or experience him or her.[11] Lastly, normative barriers, such as laws and social norms, restrain others
from attempting to access or experience an individual.[11]

Secrecy
Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy. Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to 
"conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage". [12][13]

In various legal contexts, when privacy is described as secrecy, a conclusion if privacy is secrecy then rights 
to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed.[14] When privacy-as-secrecy is
discussed, it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information 
secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private.[14]
